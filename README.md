# Real Time Database research

The objective of this project is to conduct research about and run benchmarks and tests against several decentralized storage solutions and try to answer a question of how much theyâ€™re suitable as a Real Time database for a custom blockchain under certain requirements.

## Prerequisites

We have these requirements:

  * FreeTON blockchain
  * 300-400 nodes in a network

And a storage solution should:

  * be key-value storage
  * be decentralized
  * have read-write operations should be performed within 1 second, at most under 3 seconds
  * have support of replications


## Results

Multiple storage solutions have been chosen for consideration and research such as

  * HyperBee
  * Sonar
  * GUN.io 

and the results of each one have been stored in a separate directory.
